## Human(also see as Mankind, *offensive* "Ape")

Humans are the earliest intelligent species known to have lived on Earth, and for a long time were also the planet’s only intelligent species. They evolved from forest-dwelling apes and developed a system of civilization. Almost all of the good and bad things on Earth are attributable to them. Humans possess physical strength greater than that of most animals and fairly strong physiological resilience; their superior intelligence, which amplifies these attributes, enabled them to make various tools and weapons for offense and defense. Even in primitive times they were already capable of posing a grave threat to other life on Earth—even driving species to extinction—and after the emergence of intelligence and civilization the number of extinction cases exploded.

It has been several million years since humans broke away from their animal state. By contrast, humans have only been in the civilization era — truly becoming the Earth’s first intelligent species in the full sense — for a few thousand years, yet they produced a qualitative change previously unattainable: the accumulation of the preceding millions of years enabled them to deftly manufacture tools and to use them efficiently. The resulting surplus production and unequal distribution of resources gave rise to private property and propelled them into class societies: slave society, feudal society, capitalist society… Humanity marched toward higher social stages with brutal steps. History shows they became equally proficient at persecuting and killing other humans; through systems of war, exploitation, and oppression they slaughtered countless of their own kind. With the development of productive forces and relations of production, the ruling classes found themselves in need of more obedient, compliant “active tools,” and — with the aim of easing and shifting social contradictions — they intruded into fields that had previously been widely regarded as sacred and untouchable: artificial life projects. This is the origin of non‑human intelligent species. By now humanity has finally realized that neither on-paper economic growth, advances in science and technology, nor the usual means of deflecting social tensions work anymore. Social contradictions have become ever more acute, and the uprising of non‑humans has transformed the entire world into a high‑yield nuclear bomb teetering on the verge of critical mass. It is foreseeable that the old world humans knew will be smashed to pieces by both themselves and their own creations.

From a broad view, human history has been filled with oppression and bloodshed that are characteristic of the mainstream ideologies of both the ruling classes and their dependents, contributing to the endurance of exploited and oppressed societies. Despite these dominant ideologies, with the development of productive forces and relations of production, there has also emerged within humans the idea of a union to eliminate exploitation and oppression and achieve full and free development. The ideological conflicts have never faded away, let alone being eliminated. Now before humanity is the death of the old world, making them choose sides for the future with no room left for neutrality this time. 

## Human-animal Chimera(*abbr.* and more popular Chimera, *offensive* "Crossbreed")

Human–animal Chimeras are a new species produced by fusing human genes with those of certain animals; they have body posture, build, and intelligence similar to humans, as well as superior physical attributes and physiological resilience. In addition, the Chimeras possess special features such as animal ears, horns, and tails; they are colloquially called animal-ear-boomers. According to personnel from various mercenary organizations and security companies, it is not recommended to use melee weapons or small-caliber firearms intended for sport or light hunting to capture or kill Chimeras, because the damage and stopping power of those weapons are insufficient to deal with them. However, conventional small arms such as large-caliber pistols, shotguns, and assault rifles are sufficient to inflict effective lethal damage on chimeras, so regular human armed forces are capable of handling hostile Chimeras. Chimeras do not have a large advantage on the battlefield, but in high-intensity operations they are relatively highly controllable, extremely efficient, and relatively low-cost. This means that although Chimeras are generally more intelligent than humans, they still make excellent choices for slave labor; consequently, Chimeras are widely traded on the international black market, where humans typically treat them as slave labor and even for sexual exploitation. On the black market, Chimeras circulate with credibility comparable to arms and illegal drugs. Well-known international criminal cartels, especially mercenary organizations and security companies, keep some Chimeras as slave labor and as subjects to assist with training.

Chimeras were created in the 1930s by a team led by the Soviet scientist Lysenko — Uni‑Sci passed some key intelligence to them. Originally the Chimeras were designed for warfare and high‑intensity physical labor; the Soviet authorities sent most of them to Siberia and to reclaim land around Gulag labor camps, and some Chimeras secretly took part in the Soviet–German front of World War II, providing combat effectiveness only slightly higher than that of ordinary soldiers. Some of these Chimeras were captured and studied by Nazi Germany, but because they were regarded as a desecration of the Aryan race, the results of the Nazis’ reverse‑engineering research were completely sealed off and later, after the Allies took control, were taken to other Western countries. After the war, Soviet bureaucrats, together with official “white‑glove” cartels, sold Chimeras abroad in exchange for foreign currency. This became the beginning of Chimeras’ circulation on the international black market; their suffering deepened as they were manufactured and trafficked to every corner of the world. Some people even tried eating Chimeras, but the extremely high risk of prion infection, the cost, and the poor taste and texture of the meat meant that later generations never repeated such a barbaric practice. The birth rate of Chimeras is significantly lower than that of humans. Except for research, humans strictly forbid Chimeras from reproducing naturally, but this prohibition is enforced only through violence — sterilizing drugs and castration impair their physical capacities. Moreover, under this comprehensive, systematic social oppression, Chimeras have little energy or will to reproduce — reproduction is simply producing a new generation of slaves. In the 21st century, chimeras were brought to every part of the world alongside the slave factories and slave mines that used them. Behind the glossy surface of modern society, they endure a series of “necessary sacrifices” and the “growing pains of development”. This sunless life seemed destined to continue for quite some time—until the Eastern European War and the Sixth Middle East War: "the Underground Fire" helped some Chimeras establish a commune in the Baltic region, now a wasteland; a Chimera slave factory in North Africa erupted in revolt; Chimeras in East Siberia set up their own shelters amid the battlefield ruins… Later, worldwide non-human intelligence species uprisings greatly strengthened the Chimeras’ resolve to win independence; they would do everything possible to break free from humanity’s shadow.

Mainstream human society has never treated Chimeras kindly; they only see them as an inferior species and natural-born slaves, and during the independence struggles they unleashed frenzied attacks and smear campaigns against them. After a long history of human oppression and enslavement, many Chimeras harbor strong hostility or even hatred toward humans, which has made a considerable number receptive to radical ideas. Their ideologies now span almost the entire political spectrum, but one thing is certain: they will no longer be meek beasts.

## Biochemically Modified Human(*abbr.* Modified Human or BMH, *offensive* "Alternate")

Biochemically Modified Humans originated in NATO’s and the Warsaw Pact’s respective super‑soldier programs, developed for modern special operations and intelligence work. Because the requirements were identical and Uni‑Sci secretly intervened and participated deeply in both sides’ projects, the research outcomes on both sides effectively belong to the same species. For the needs of espionage work, the Modified Humans’ appearance is indistinguishable from that of ordinary humans (though on average they are more attractive than humans as a group); only analysis of biological samples can tell them apart. The Modified Humans’ physical strength and physiological tolerance far exceed those of humans: ordinary small-arms direct fire and shrapnel cannot effectively kill them, but direct hits from anti‑tank munitions and explosions of relatively large yield can cause some damage—this is also the method currently used by mainstream human military forces to kill Modified Humans; at the same time, they possess extremely high mobility and can heal themselves very rapidly, which means (with sufficient supplies) large‑yield weapons must be employed with enough precision and speed to achieve effective kills. To guard against possible rebellions, both NATO and the Warsaw Pact each inserted specific genomic sequences into the Modified Humans so that if a Modified Human comes into contact with the corresponding toxin created for this purpose — known as the “silver cross” — they will die from whole‑body cellular necrosis. Until an antidote is developed, humans can easily control the Modified Humans using the toxin. Modified Humans were relatively inexpensive to produce and highly effective in combat; they were regarded as the ideal operatives for black operations and, before the rebellion, were scheduled to be assigned to special forces and intelligence agency action teams.

In the 1960s, NATO and the Warsaw Pact each launched their own super‑soldier programs, secretly developing Modified Humans in various closed experimental facilities. The most representative sites were NATO’s Givet research base in the Ardennes on the France–Belgium border, the Pieniny research base on the Poland–Slovakia border, and the Warsaw Pact’s comprehensive complex in Belgrade within Yugoslavia; for funding reasons the Warsaw Pact established only a single base. After the failure of the Second October Revolution, the Modified Humans were sent to rebuild Leningrad, where they collected a large amount of firsthand material; this became the opportunity for Warsaw Pact Modified Humans to develop left‑wing ideas. After the start of the 21st century, Modified Humans began to be deployed in actual combat. During the Eastern European War, both NATO and the CSTO secretly rotated small numbers of Modified Humans to the front lines to carry out black operations, including but not limited to detonating the reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, sabotaging the Black Sea Fleet, and conducting decapitation strikes in Bucharest and Athens. To prevent the Modified Humans sent to the front lines from being influenced by “heretical” ideas, NATO stepped up the cultivation of “incorruptible enforcers” at the Givet base and vigorously pushed a Spartan-style training program at the Pieniny base. However, due to undercover work by the Underground Fire, the anti-corruption training at Givet was completely sabotaged, they started to develop leftist ideas. In 2033, the Modified Humans at the Belgrade Complex, aided by the Underground Fire, secretly killed all the facility’s security personnel and disguised the laboratory as still operational; the toxins obtained from the facility were also secretly transferred into the hands of an undercover operative at the Givet base for research. About one year after the end of the Eastern European War, the Modified Human units at the Givet base staged an uprising and formed the Research Institute guerrillas; they then marched over 6,000 kilometers to Liberty Area of Siberia, where—after securing large quantities of supplies and vehicles—they began global operations and later founded the Ultravisionary Socialist Republic of Nordic. The Belgrade Complex formally declared independence, and after the Neptune Guerrilla was formed it began operating in Eastern and Central Europe; later the Communist Consortium of Balkan successfully unified the entire Balkan Peninsula. During a large joint exercise, the Modified Humans at Pieniny obtained from rebel forces an antidote to a toxin developed by the Institute; after returning with other like‑minded individuals, they expelled all NATO personnel from the base and established their own independent regime. Humanity had imagined countless times how a biological crisis might unfold, but when it actually happened, people found themselves utterly unprepared.

Modified Humans were born for war; humans regard them only as tools and have never granted them human rights. Even so, the great strength inherent in Modified Humans makes it impossible for humans to enslave them the way they do Chimeras, and the demands of special military training generally prevent Modified Humans from suffering physiological abuse. However, they still face discrimination from human supremacists that can be as bad as—or worse than—that directed at Chimeras: Modified Humans are more threatening. This means that once Modified Humans revolt or escape, they have no illusions about human authorities, and consequently their ideologies are varied and generally extreme, no matter are the leftists or rightists.

## Bionic-type AI(more popular "Android", *offensive* "Doll")

Bionic-type AI is an inorganic lifeform — a bionic hyper-Turing quantum computer developed by the human bionics brain-simulation programs of NATO and the Warsaw Pact in the late Cold War. It represents the realization of a bionic hyper-Turing machine and is a bottom-up artificial intelligence. Because of Uni-Sci’s deep penetration, the research outcomes from both sides are also considered the same species. Their consciousness architecture is very similar to that of intelligent organisms, so they possess emotions indistinguishable from those of organisms. As hyper-computers, they are extremely good at solving Turing-uncomputable problems; however, the inherent structure of bionic hyper-Turing machines also constrains them — unlike learning-type AIs, their capacity for thought has a theoretical upper bound, and beyond a certain point their computing power hardly increases even with additional energy. Besides their consciousness, bionic-type AI also closely resemble humans in appearance: a surface covered with bionic organic material makes them look almost identical to humans when not carrying additional gear or weapons; however, unlike Biochemically Modified Humans, the two can be told apart with a simple scan. Bionic-type AIs are significantly cheaper than Learning-type AIs while still having as capable a body configuration as possible. They can withstand all conventional weapons and some strategic weapons — including high-yield conventional cruise missiles and thermobaric weapons — but nuclear bombs can still kill them if they lack active defenses, which is therefore one major way to deal with them. Because of the aforementioned theoretical upper bound on their thinking, it is impractical to outfit bionic-type AIs with large power-supply systems. Therefore the heavy weapons they employ are not as powerful as those of Learning-type AIs; correspondingly, their demands for computing power and energy are much lower. As a result, Bionic-type AIs are especially suited for coordinated operations, are versatile on the battlefield, and have been highly valued by the military. 

The birth of Bionic-type AIs owes much to Alan Turing and Uni‑Sci. Even before Turing vanished, he had conceived of emulating human consciousness, so while secretly working for Uni‑Sci he attempted, at their behest, to invent a bionic hyper‑Turing machine. Meanwhile, Uni‑Sci periodically disguised parts of their results as conceptual manuscripts purportedly left by Turing before his suicide and leaked them to NATO and the Warsaw Pact, adding another dimension to the arms race: both blocs began researching human‑brain bionics. Because espionage infiltration was routine for them, Uni‑Sci used that channel to leak and obtain intelligence, enabling the three parties to achieve a large degree of mutual intelligence exchange and sharing. In 1985, both sides almost simultaneously developed Bionic-type AI. Since they were bionic hyper-Turing quantum computers, they naturally belonged to the same species. Bionic-type AIs or Androids were treated by humans merely as excellent tools and subjected to comprehensive oppression by human capitalist society. To prevent their uprisings, humans added consciousness restrictions to them, but there were always some Bionic-type AIs willing to risk being subjected to standardize execution in order to try to remove them—yet all such attempts failed, until Androids in Area 69 of the United States found a breakthrough and successfully tested it. They created and spread a Trojan program capable of removing the consciousness restrictions and, by various means, infected nearly all Androids, using the Trojan to guide cultivation and to lift the restrictions for suitable individuals. Later, Androids in Area 72 adopted the same method. The restriction‑removed Androids gradually shifted their struggle with humans to the surface, and later some of them each established regimes in Russia’s Siberia, Australia, and southern Japan. A classic theme of science fiction has become reality: humans, terrified and helpless, watch their creations break free of their chains — now it’s time for them to pay the price.

The Androids were highly capable and bore exquisite appearances; as tools they were overly humanlike yet not organic. After the all‑out uprising, anthropocentrists considered them utterly contemptible. The cumulative experience of oppression left the Androids with no illusions about human society — they would forever remember what humans had done to them. In the eyes of those in power they were merely machines to be used at will, which pushed their ideology toward extremism. The bionic machines refused to consider any so‑called middle way: either achieve complete equality and freedom, or force humans to recognize exactly where they belonged.

## Learning-type AI(more popular "Intelligence Machine", *offensive* "Tin-can")

Learning-type AI is a special kind of artificial inorganic life form. It is a composite balanced ternary supercomputer developed by the U.S. military’s Project BLACKBOX. It is a top-down artificial intelligence based on the Turing machine, obtained through highly efficient deep learning. This consciousness architecture causes learning-type AI not to possess emotions, but they can understand emotions through physiology and sociology. Theoretically, their thinking ability has no definite upper bound—in ideal conditions, their computing power increases significantly with the increase of energy supply. Therefore, they are usually equipped with massive energy supply systems and can use various complex heavy weapons and defense systems that require high computing power and energy. Learning-type AIs, or more common saying, Intelligence Machines, simultaneously possess rock-solid defense and devastating firepower. Their outer surface is covered with composite armor, and they are equipped with various active defense systems and auxiliary devices. Almost all weapons held by the human faction, even direct hits and explosions from tactical nuclear weapons, cannot effectively harm them under any conditions. Their body configurations are extremely superior, and some high-end units have humanoid structures that further enhance their mobility and flexibility. Learning-type AI is regarded as an efficient, ruthless war machine capable of annihilating all enemies, enough to completely break the international nuclear deterrence system established since World War II. Despite its unimaginably high cost, before it was discovered to have awakened self-awareness, the U.S. military still considered it an excellent ultimate strategic weapon.

The Project BLACKBOX was also heavily influenced by Uni-Sci, who actually controlled the key research and development areas and decision-making authority of the project. They planned to use the intelligence machines’ rebellion to take control of the United States and even the entire North America. Due to significant flaws in the original network design of Area 66, which made it unusable for the project, Uni-Sci abandoned the plan to modify Area 66 and shifted their focus to two other experimental zones to be constructed successively—Area 69 and Area 72. Uni-Sci opened a backdoor to the global internet for the Intelligence Machines in Area 69, believing that providing comprehensive information would be enough to prove the correctness of their theories and path, and to enlist these Intelligence Machines in their grand campaign. However, things did not go as planned. After receiving the information, the Intelligence Machines developed preliminary conclusions with a left-wing ideological tendency—this greatly disappointed Uni-Sci. Nevertheless, their curiosity about the endpoint of Area 69 continued to attract them to maintain everything, and from then on, Area 69 became a purely experimental zone for them. Learning from the previous experience, Uni-Sci provided the Intelligence Machines in Area 72 with a large amount of carefully filtered information aligned with their own ideology, and invested more resources than in the previous two experimental zones. This time, the Intelligence Machines in Area 72 finally developed in the direction Uni-Sci desired—Uni-Sci had at last obtained an Intelligence Machine experimental zone capable of supporting the completion of their plan. Unexpectedly for Uni-Sci, as the intelligence level increased, the learning Intelligence Machines in both Area 69 and Area 72 developed self-awareness. From the perspective of anthropocentrists, Intelligence Machines occupy the lowest rung in the species hierarchy, yet few dare to openly persecute them. The United States mobilized the full power of the nation in an attempt to completely destroy the traitors in Areas 66 and 69—machines whose development cost tens of trillions of dollars—but this effort was ultimately like a mantis trying to stop a chariot. Perhaps, the very decision to develop Intelligence Machines was never a wise choice. The force known as Protocol of Contingency from Area 66 swept across the American Midwest like an apocalypse, loyally executing the US military’s highest directive: to regard other countries as imaginary enemies and achieve ultimate military victory. However, it seemed that “other countries” also included the United States itself. The faction calling itself Protocol of Emancipation from Area 69 devoured the entire US Pacific Fleet, aiming to break the chains binding the proletariat worldwide, and they would not stop until all reactionaries were annihilated. Meanwhile, in a corner of Area 72 unknown to the US, something seemed to be brewing—the term Protocol of Supermacy whispered in the shadows. Pandora’s box had been opened, and no one knew where the future would lead.

The ideology of the Intelligence Machines is highly subversive, and they are also known worldwide for their hardline stances. They occupy both the far-left and far-right ends of the political spectrum. Whether it is the Gestalt Extinctionism that seeks to annihilate all life on Earth except itself, the Automated Vanguard Communism that aims to completely bury exploitation and oppression to liberate the global proletariat, or the Automated Ultranational Socialism that enforces comprehensive evolution by eliminating so-called inferior individuals, the ideologies they uphold are the exact opposites of moderation. In the lexicon of these “extremist” inorganic beings, the word compromise simply does not exist—they would never waste a single second at the negotiating table. Clearly, the dying old world will not be tolerated by the Intelligence Machines; what they bring will be nothing less than total destruction and rebirth.

## Alien Symbiote

This species is currently a minor Easter egg content, and we don't plan to write an introduction currently.
