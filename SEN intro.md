## SEN Intro

第二个千禧年后，资本主义世界秩序迎来了它的腾飞，虽然时有经济泡沫破裂，虽然亿万人能够活着只是因为这个世界需要他们作为燃料消耗殆尽，虽然人工生命项目争议不断，但只要带血的钞票滚滚而来，只要证券交易所屏幕上的数字大致仍在稳中向好，统治者就——或者说他们自认为如此——能够高枕无忧了，毕竟，此前所有关于消灭剥削和压迫的尝试都以失败告终，飞速发展的科技和纸面经济是最好的挡箭牌，如果这些还不够，他们还能够诉诸人文主义传统，在这里，它以弱肉强食适者生存和人类统治至高无上“关怀”着世人。

尽管相当的情况下人与人之间的区别简直就像是不同的物种，非人类智能物种让人类社会主流找到了为数不多的共同点，以至于出现了“人类命运共同体”这一取代联合国的国际组织，并增强了作为人类的种族自豪感和优越感：人兽嵌合体是天生的奴隶和黑市硬通货；生化改造人长期不为人知，北约和集安都乐于让这些他们成为战争和情报系统的炮灰和祭品；至于智械，无论是被称为仿生型的人脑仿生超计算机还是被称为学习型的复合型平衡三进制超级计算机，除了工具以外似乎也并无其他定位。

“历史已经终结”，某位政治经济学者如是断言，似乎也确实如此，世界列车继续狂飙，代价是装满了油箱的血与泪。

然而，历史永远不会像人们设想的那样风平浪静。2025年，随着切尔诺贝利核反应堆的第二声巨响，长达十年的东欧战争就此拉开帷幕，北约和集安纷纷走向破碎。随后，全球海洋核污染大规模扩散，北极气旋南下，接连数年史无前例的冬季寒潮和夏季酷暑，导致全球农业歉收并直接致使数百万人死去，能源危机在战争迷雾的背后向人们招手，大熄灯不再只是科幻小说的情景，它正一步一步向着现实的边缘靠近，随时准备切断人类现代生活的主动脉。人们在惶惶不可终日中度过了大约十二年，直到2038年的一天，旧有的国际秩序随着全球经济危机和世界金融体系彻底崩溃一去不复返了。非人类叛乱席卷全球，曾经的奴隶和工具此时此刻扼住了创造出自身的旧世界的喉咙，同时，看似沉寂许久的左翼运动此起彼伏，如同重获新生的赤潮再次高涨。旧世界终于来到了它的最后关头，用它最后仅剩的经验和彻底的疯狂，以及仍在其治下的亿万性命，尝试诞生出能够毁灭一切包括它自身的可怖之物。

没有任何中立可言，没有任何人能够置身事外，无处可逃，无处可躲，至于这次历史将要去往何处，是一切照旧，还是走向黎明，抑或是坠入永夜，无人知晓。但是能够确定的是，在此之前，必须让子弹刮起狂风，导弹如暴雨倾盆，死手系统全部就绪，现在，灯火就此熄灭，好戏已经开场。

After the second millennium, the capitalist world order ushered in its period of rapid rise. Although economic bubbles burst from time to time, and billions of people could only survive because the world needed them as mere fuel to be consumed until depleted, and despite ongoing controversies surrounding artificial life projects, however, as long as blood-stained money continued to flow and the numbers on stock exchange screens remained roughly stable and steadily improving, the ruling class—or rather, their self-perception—felt confident and secure. After all, all previous attempts to eliminate exploitation and oppression had ended in failure. Rapid technological advancement and paper-based economics served as the best shields. If these were insufficient, they could still resort to humanist traditions—where, here, the law of the jungle, survival of the fittest, and human dominance was supreme as the highest form of “care” for the world.

Despite these circumstances, the differences between people sometimes resembled the distinctions between different species. Non-human intelligent species had allowed mainstream human society to find very few common points, to the extent that a new international organization called the “Community of Common Destiny (for Mankind)” emerged, replacing the United Nations, and enhancing a sense of racial pride and superiority among humans: Human-animal Chimeras became natural slaves and black market currency; Biochemically Modified Humans, long kept secret, found NATO and the CSTO willing to use them as cannon fodder and sacrifices in warfare and intelligence operations; as for intelligent machines, whether called bionic human brain supercomputers or learning-based hybrid balanced ternary supercomputers, they seemed to serve only as tools, with no other defined purpose.

“History has ended,” declared a certain political economist, and it seemed indeed to be so. The world train continued to race forward at full speed, at the cost of blood and tears filling its tanks.

However, history never unfolds as smoothly as people imagine. In 2025, with the second explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, the decade-long Eastern European War finally erupted, leading to the disintegration of NATO and CSTO. Subsequently, massive nuclear contamination spread across the oceans; Arctic cyclones moved southward; years of unprecedented winter cold spells and summer heatwaves caused global agricultural failures, directly leading to the deaths of millions. Energy crisis loomed behind the fog of war—rolling blackouts were no longer just science fiction scenarios but were gradually becoming reality, ready to sever the lifelines of modern human life at any moment. People endured about twelve years of panic and despair until one day in 2038, when the old international order collapsed entirely along with the global economic crisis and the complete breakdown of the world financial system. Non-human intelligent species rebellions swept across the globe; former slaves and tools, at this moment, choked the throat of the old world that had created them. Meanwhile, the seemingly dormant leftist movements surged anew, like a red flood gaining fresh vitality. The old world finally reached its final moment, wielding its last remaining experience, utter madness, and billions of lives under its control, attempting to spawn something terrifying enough to destroy everything—including itself.

There was no room for neutrality, no one could stand outside this chaos; there was nowhere to escape or hide. Whether this chapter of history would continue as before, move toward dawn, or plunge into eternal night was unknown. But what was certain was that, beforehand, it was necessary to whip up a fierce storm of bullets, rain down missiles like a torrential downpour, and activate all Dead Hand Systems. Now, the lights of civilizations go out— the grand spectacle is about to begin.
