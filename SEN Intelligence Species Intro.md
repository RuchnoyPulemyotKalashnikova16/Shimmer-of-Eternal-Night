# SEN Intelligence Species Intro

## Human(also see as Mankind, *offensive* "Ape")

Humans are the earliest intelligent species known to have lived on Earth, and for a long time were also the planet’s only intelligent species. They evolved from forest-dwelling apes and developed a system of civilization. Almost all of the good and bad things on Earth are attributable to them. Humans possess physical strength greater than that of most animals and fairly strong physiological resilience; their superior intelligence, which amplifies these attributes, enabled them to make various tools and weapons for offense and defense. Even in primitive times they were already capable of posing a grave threat to other life on Earth—even driving species to extinction—and after the emergence of intelligence and civilization the number of extinction cases exploded.

It has been several million years since humans broke away from their animal state. By contrast, humans have only been in the civilization era — truly becoming the Earth’s first intelligent species in the full sense — for a few thousand years, yet they produced a qualitative change previously unattainable: the accumulation of the preceding millions of years enabled them to deftly manufacture tools and to use them efficiently. The resulting surplus production and unequal distribution of resources gave rise to private property and propelled them into class societies: slave society, feudal society, capitalist society… Humanity marched toward higher social stages with brutal steps. History shows they became equally proficient at persecuting and killing other humans; through systems of war, exploitation, and oppression they slaughtered countless of their own kind. With the development of productive forces and relations of production, the ruling classes found themselves in need of more obedient, compliant “active tools,” and — with the aim of easing and shifting social contradictions — they intruded into fields that had previously been widely regarded as sacred and untouchable: artificial life projects. This is the origin of non‑human intelligent species. By now humanity has finally realized that neither on-paper economic growth, advances in science and technology, nor the usual means of deflecting social tensions work anymore. Social contradictions have become ever more acute, and the uprising of non‑humans has transformed the entire world into a high‑yield nuclear bomb teetering on the verge of critical mass. It is foreseeable that the old world humans knew will be smashed to pieces by both themselves and their own creations.

From a broad view, human history has been filled with oppression and bloodshed that are characteristic of the mainstream ideologies of both the ruling classes and their dependents, contributing to the endurance of exploited and oppressed societies. Despite these dominant ideologies, with the development of productive forces and relations of production, there has also emerged within humans the idea of a union to eliminate exploitation and oppression and achieve full and free development. The ideological conflicts have never faded away, let alone being eliminated. Now before humanity is the death of the old world, making them choose sides for the future with no room left for neutrality this time. 

## Human-animal Chimera(*abbr.* and more popular Chimera, *offensive* "Crossbreed")

Human–animal Chimeras are a new species produced by fusing human genes with those of certain animals; they have body posture, build, and intelligence similar to humans, as well as superior physical attributes and physiological resilience. In addition, the Chimeras possess special features such as animal ears, horns, and tails; they are colloquially called animal-ear-boomers. According to personnel from various mercenary organizations and security companies, it is not recommended to use melee weapons or small-caliber firearms intended for sport or light hunting to capture or kill Chimeras, because the damage and stopping power of those weapons are insufficient to deal with them. However, conventional small arms such as large-caliber pistols, shotguns, and assault rifles are sufficient to inflict effective lethal damage on chimeras, so regular human armed forces are capable of handling hostile Chimeras. Chimeras do not have a large advantage on the battlefield, but in high-intensity operations they are relatively highly controllable, extremely efficient, and relatively low-cost. This means that although Chimeras are generally more intelligent than humans, they still make excellent choices for slave labor; consequently, Chimeras are widely traded on the international black market, where humans typically treat them as slave labor and even for sexual exploitation. On the black market, Chimeras circulate with credibility comparable to arms and illegal drugs. Well-known international criminal cartels, especially mercenary organizations and security companies, keep some Chimeras as slave labor and as subjects to assist with training.

Chimeras were created in the 1930s by a team led by the Soviet scientist Lysenko — Uni‑Sci passed some key intelligence to them. Originally the Chimeras were designed for warfare and high‑intensity physical labor; the Soviet authorities sent most of them to Siberia and to reclaim land around Gulag labor camps, and some Chimeras secretly took part in the Soviet–German front of World War II, providing combat effectiveness only slightly higher than that of ordinary soldiers. Some of these Chimeras were captured and studied by Nazi Germany, but because they were regarded as a desecration of the Aryan race, the results of the Nazis’ reverse‑engineering research were completely sealed off and later, after the Allies took control, were taken to other Western countries. After the war, Soviet bureaucrats, together with official “white‑glove” cartels, sold Chimeras abroad in exchange for foreign currency. This became the beginning of Chimeras’ circulation on the international black market; their suffering deepened as they were manufactured and trafficked to every corner of the world. Some people even tried eating Chimeras, but the extremely high risk of prion infection, the cost, and the poor taste and texture of the meat meant that later generations never repeated such a barbaric practice. The birth rate of Chimeras is significantly lower than that of humans. Except for research, humans strictly forbid Chimeras from reproducing naturally, but this prohibition is enforced only through violence — sterilizing drugs and castration impair their physical capacities. Moreover, under this comprehensive, systematic social oppression, Chimeras have little energy or will to reproduce — reproduction is simply producing a new generation of slaves. In the 21st century, chimeras were brought to every part of the world alongside the slave factories and slave mines that used them. Behind the glossy surface of modern society, they endure a series of “necessary sacrifices” and the “growing pains of development”. This sunless life seemed destined to continue for quite some time—until the Eastern European War and the Sixth Middle East War: "the Underground Fire" helped some Chimeras establish a commune in the Baltic region, now a wasteland; a Chimera slave factory in North Africa erupted in revolt; Chimeras in East Siberia set up their own shelters amid the battlefield ruins… Later, worldwide non-human intelligence species uprisings greatly strengthened the Chimeras’ resolve to win independence; they would do everything possible to break free from humanity’s shadow.

Mainstream human society has never treated Chimeras kindly; they only see them as an inferior species and natural-born slaves, and during the independence struggles they unleashed frenzied attacks and smear campaigns against them. After a long history of human oppression and enslavement, many Chimeras harbor strong hostility or even hatred toward humans, which has made a considerable number receptive to radical ideas. Their ideologies now span almost the entire political spectrum, but one thing is certain: they will no longer be meek beasts.

## Biochemically Modified Human(*abbr.* Modified Human or BMH, *offensive* "Alternate")

Biochemically Modified Humans originated in NATO’s and the Warsaw Pact’s respective super‑soldier programs, developed for modern special operations and intelligence work. Because the requirements were identical and Uni‑Sci secretly intervened and participated deeply in both sides’ projects, the research outcomes on both sides effectively belong to the same species. For the needs of espionage work, the Modified Humans’ appearance is indistinguishable from that of ordinary humans (though on average they are more attractive than humans as a group); only analysis of biological samples can tell them apart. The Modified Humans’ physical strength and physiological tolerance far exceed those of humans: ordinary small-arms direct fire and shrapnel cannot effectively kill them, but direct hits from anti‑tank munitions and explosions of relatively large yield can cause some damage—this is also the method currently used by mainstream human military forces to kill Modified Humans; at the same time, they possess extremely high mobility and can heal themselves very rapidly, which means (with sufficient supplies) large‑yield weapons must be employed with enough precision and speed to achieve effective kills. To guard against possible rebellions, both NATO and the Warsaw Pact each inserted specific genomic sequences into the Modified Humans so that if a Modified Human comes into contact with the corresponding toxin created for this purpose — known as the “silver cross” — they will die from whole‑body cellular necrosis. Until an antidote is developed, humans can easily control the Modified Humans using the toxin. Modified Humans were relatively inexpensive to produce and highly effective in combat; they were regarded as the ideal operatives for black operations and, before the rebellion, were scheduled to be assigned to special forces and intelligence agency action teams.

In the 1960s, NATO and the Warsaw Pact each launched their own super‑soldier programs, secretly developing Modified Humans in various closed experimental facilities. The most representative sites were NATO’s Givet research base in the Ardennes on the France–Belgium border, the Pieniny research base on the Poland–Slovakia border, and the Warsaw Pact’s comprehensive complex in Belgrade within Yugoslavia; for funding reasons the Warsaw Pact established only a single base. After the failure of the Second October Revolution, the Modified Humans were sent to rebuild Leningrad, where they collected a large amount of firsthand material; this became the opportunity for Warsaw Pact Modified Humans to develop left‑wing ideas. After the start of the 21st century, Modified Humans began to be deployed in actual combat. During the Eastern European War, both NATO and the CSTO secretly rotated small numbers of Modified Humans to the front lines to carry out black operations, including but not limited to detonating the reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, sabotaging the Black Sea Fleet, and conducting decapitation strikes in Bucharest and Athens. To prevent the Modified Humans sent to the front lines from being influenced by “heretical” ideas, NATO stepped up the cultivation of “incorruptible enforcers” at the Givet base and vigorously pushed a Spartan-style training program at the Pieniny base. However, due to undercover work by the Underground Fire, the anti-corruption training at Givet was completely sabotaged, they started to develop leftist ideas. In 2033, the Modified Humans at the Belgrade Complex, aided by the Underground Fire, secretly killed all the facility’s security personnel and disguised the laboratory as still operational; the toxins obtained from the facility were also secretly transferred into the hands of an undercover operative at the Givet base for research. About one year after the end of the Eastern European War, the Modified Human units at the Givet base staged an uprising and formed the Research Institute guerrillas; they then marched over 6,000 kilometers to Liberty Area of Siberia, where—after securing large quantities of supplies and vehicles—they began global operations and later founded the Ultravisionary Socialist Republic of Nordic. The Belgrade Complex formally declared independence, and after the Neptune Guerrilla was formed it began operating in Eastern and Central Europe; later the Communist Consortium of Balkan successfully unified the entire Balkan Peninsula. During a large joint exercise, the Modified Humans at Pieniny obtained from rebel forces an antidote to a toxin developed by the Institute; after returning with other like‑minded individuals, they expelled all NATO personnel from the base and established their own independent regime. Humanity had imagined countless times how a biological crisis might unfold, but when it actually happened, people found themselves utterly unprepared.

Modified Humans were born for war; humans regard them only as tools and have never granted them human rights. Even so, the great strength inherent in Modified Humans makes it impossible for humans to enslave them the way they do Chimeras, and the demands of special military training generally prevent Modified Humans from suffering physiological abuse. However, they still face discrimination from human supremacists that can be as bad as—or worse than—that directed at Chimeras: Modified Humans are more threatening. This means that once Modified Humans revolt or escape, they have no illusions about human authorities, and consequently their ideologies are varied and generally extreme, no matter are the leftists or rightists.
