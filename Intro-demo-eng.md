After the second millennium, the capitalist world order ushered in its period of rapid rise. Although economic bubbles burst from time to time, and billions of people could only survive because the world needed them as mere fuel to be consumed until depleted, and despite ongoing controversies surrounding artificial life projects, however, as long as blood-stained money continued to flow and the numbers on stock exchange screens remained roughly stable and steadily improving, the ruling class—or rather, their self-perception—felt confident and secure. After all, all previous attempts to eliminate exploitation and oppression had ended in failure. Rapid technological advancement and paper-based economics served as the best shields. If these were insufficient, they could still resort to humanist traditions—where, here, the law of the jungle, survival of the fittest, and human dominance was supreme as the highest form of “care” for the world.

Despite these circumstances, the differences between people sometimes resembled the distinctions between different species. Non-human intelligent species had allowed mainstream human society to find very few common points, to the extent that a new international organization called the “Community of Common Destiny (for Mankind)” emerged, replacing the United Nations, and enhancing a sense of racial pride and superiority among humans: Human-animal Chimeras became natural slaves and black market currency; Biochemically Modified Humans, long kept secret, found NATO and the CSTO willing to use them as cannon fodder and sacrifices in warfare and intelligence operations; as for intelligent machines, whether called bionic human brain hypercomputers or learning-based hybrid balanced ternary supercomputers, they seemed to serve only as tools, with no other defined purpose.

“History has ended,” declared a certain political economist, and it seemed indeed to be so. The world train continued to race forward at full speed, at the cost of blood and tears filling its tanks.

However, history never unfolds as smoothly as people imagine. In 2025, with the second explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, the decade-long Eastern European War finally erupted, leading to the disintegration of NATO and CSTO. Subsequently, massive nuclear contamination spread across the oceans; Arctic cyclones moved southward; years of unprecedented winter cold spells and summer heatwaves caused global agricultural failures, directly leading to the deaths of millions. Energy crisis loomed behind the fog of war—rolling blackouts were no longer just science fiction scenarios but were gradually becoming reality, ready to sever the lifelines of modern human life at any moment. People endured about twelve years of panic and despair until one day in 2038, when the old international order collapsed entirely along with the global economic crisis and the complete breakdown of the world financial system. Non-human intelligent species rebellions swept across the globe; former slaves and tools, at this moment, choked the throat of the old world that had created them. Meanwhile, the seemingly dormant leftist movements surged anew, like a red flood gaining fresh vitality. The old world finally reached its final moment, wielding its last remaining experience, utter madness, and billions of lives under its control, attempting to spawn something terrifying enough to destroy everything—including itself.

There was no room for neutrality, no one could stand outside this chaos; there was nowhere to escape or hide. Whether this chapter of history would continue as before, move toward dawn, or plunge into eternal night was unknown. But what was certain was that, beforehand, it was necessary to whip up a fierce storm of bullets, rain down missiles like a torrential downpour, and activate all Dead Hand Systems. Now, the lights of civilizations go out— the grand spectacle is about to begin.
